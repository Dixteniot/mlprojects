DIY Project No. 27001
List some mission critical issues that you would like the AI Agent to solve.

Within the context of the Esithilami case study. The AI Agent could ask some questions. Why would the poor man steal the essential public infrastructure materials like copper cables, and the rich man buys them and sell them to the global market as as scrap material?

At some point in time the AI Agent should be able to answer it's own complex questions. At least it should learn how to answer complex questions. Machine learning do just that. But how? The AI Agent learns from its environmental and its surroundings. Within the environment space and time there are many actors and stake holders with diverse interest and diverse interest which are always competing for time. If that was not enough. Some environments were of prejudice, discrimination and inequalities. Some people called it the triple ills. Learning by your own mistakes could be destructive. Learning by the mistakes of others could be very destructive. Now that contradicts the fact that the AI Agent learns from its environment. It should not learn bad habits! But it should learn something good. The AI Agent have dilemma of nobody is perfect. What should it do? In search for role models? Politicians always point out corruption as the stumbling block to progress.
Gospel preachers always preach that everybody have sinned and have come short of the glory of God. And preach salvation by the son of God as the solution. Salvation involves believing and repentance.
Those who believe that Jesus Christ is the son of God and are baptized in the name of the Father, the Son and Holy Spirit shall be saves.

From the risk management point of view, identify some risk issues within the design of the AI Agent System. List some ways to mitigate against them.

Now the AI Agent is ready to hit the ground running at last.
One can always fine tune the smooth operation of the system, in conjunction with the quality assurance team and the user's feedback.
With complex mission critical systems omissions, negligence or mistakes could cause critical errors or malfunction.
In a real world uncontrolled errors or mistakes could lead to accidents or system corruption. One should not throw the baby with bath water.Nobody said it was going to be easy. It is always easier said than done. Planning, designing, modeling, modernization, testing is the starting point. Innovation involves just that. It couldn't be easier, could it? Of course it can! Can it?

When designing the multilingual AI Agent tool, the AI Agent could have a hard time learning the phonetics of each language. No single language has monopoly over words. Some words are used in different languages with different sounds and meanings. For example, "into": in"TWO" for English and in"THO" for Zulu.
Words can also have several meanings. For example, when translating from English into French. Some words are derived from several other languages. For example, Moses, baptize, algebra, alphabet, pentavalence, hexadecimal, bit, monopoly, etc.
